# logzio-webdav

A Docker image purpose-built to monitor Salesforce Commerce Cloud (fka Demandware) logs using New Relic Logs.

Python Application that includes modules:

pygrok
webdavclient3
watchdog
logzio-python-handler
python-decouple
python-json-logger
numpy

## Installation

1. Use `git` to clone this repository into a suitable folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/resdenia/logzio-webdav.git logzio-webdav
```

2. Define parameters

LOGZIO_LISTENER_URL=
LOGZIO_SHIPPING_KEY=

WEBDAV_USERNAME=
WEBDAV_PASSWORD=
SEND_HISTORICAL_LOGS=
SEND_UNPARSE_LOGS=
WEBDAV_DIR_LINK=
WEBDAV_DIR=
GROK_PATTERNS=

3. Use `docker` to build a container from this image:

```sh
docker build -t 'nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest' ./nr-logs-for-sfcc
```

## Usage

1. Obtain an Insights API Insert key from your account, [as described here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/use-event-api-report-custom-events#register).
2. Use the following docker command to run your container.

```sh
docker run -d -e "NEWRELIC_API_KEY=<your_Insert_API_key>" -e "SFCC_HOSTNAME=<your_sfcc_host>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_ID=<your_sfcc_client_id>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_sfcc_client_secret>" nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```

- If you prefer to store these environment variables in a file like [this example](./sfcc.env), you can run docker like so:

```sh
docker run -d --env-file=sfcc.env nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```

3. Login to New Relic and open the [Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher), look for entries with `sfcc.xxxx` as their service_name.

## Troubleshooting

If you are not seeing any logs in New Relic Logs:

1. _Wait a few minutes!_ As there are a couple steps between your logs and New Relic, it can take a few minutes for them to start rolling in, especially if you have many different log types or high log volumes.
2. Connect to your docker container at command-line and review the logs. All of the pertinent logs (`cctail.log`, `fluentd.log` and `supervisord.log`) are found in the root directory. The following example also shows how to get the container ID easily and re-use that for connecting:

```sh
thiscontainer=$(docker ps | grep nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest | head -n1 | awk '{print $1;}')
docker exec -t -i $thiscontainer /bin/sh
```

- What each log will tell you:
  - `fluentd.log` - issues with the New Relic Insert API Key or log parsing rules. Messages like `[error]: #0 Response was 403 {}` indicate an invalid or unset key.
  - `cctail.log` - issues with your SFCC credentials.
  - `supervisord.log` - container-wide issues, i.e. those caused by changes made to `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh` or `supervisord.conf`.

3. You can run cctail in Debug Mode, using the `CCTAIL_ARGS` environment variable at `docker run` time. This will send more information into `cctail.log` about what logs are being polled, and how many log records are being reported from each.

```sh
docker run -d -e "CCTAIL_ARGS=-d" -e "NEWRELIC_API_KEY=<your_Insert_API_key>" -e "SFCC_HOSTNAME=<your_sfcc_host>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_ID=<your_sfcc_client_id>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_sfcc_client_secret>" nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```

or (if using an env file):

```sh
docker run -d -e "CCTAIL_ARGS=-d" -env-file=sfcc.env nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```
